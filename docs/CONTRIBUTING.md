Thank you for contributing to Little Light! All suggestions and feature requests are welcome, and a lot better if they come with the workforce needed to make it happen.

Here are some tips to make sure your pull request can be merged smoothly:

1. If you want to add a feature or make some change to Little Light, consider [filing an issue](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/new) describing your idea first. This will give the Little Light community a chance to discuss the idea, offer suggestions and pointers, and make sure what you're thinking of fits with the style and direction of Little Light. If you want a more free-form chat, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/dTKhBD).
1. Resist the temptation to change more than one thing in your PR. Keeping PRs focused on a single change makes them much easier to review and accept. If you want to change multiple things, or clean up/refactor the code, make a new branch and submit those changes as a separate PR.
1. Little Light is written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and built in [Flutter](https://www.flutter.io)
