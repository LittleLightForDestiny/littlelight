# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/_env
    - assets/
    - assets/imgs/
    - assets/imgs/flags/
    - assets/subclasses/
    - assets/anim/
    - assets/i18n/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family:  LittleLightIcons
      fonts:
      - asset: fonts/LittleLightIcons.ttf
    - family: NeueHaasDisplay
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NeueHaasDisplay-Thin.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/NeueHaasDisplay-ThinItalic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/NeueHaasDisplay-Roman.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/NeueHaasDisplay-Medium.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/NeueHaasDisplay-Bold.ttf 
          weight: 900
